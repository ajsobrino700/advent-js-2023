# Advent java Script

This a repository of advent code by **midudev**. I chose typescript like a languages (the other option is javascript). The oficial web of the event is [adventJS](https://adventjs.dev/es).

The structure of respository is very simple. There is a folder by day where you can find a script with the solution and a little readme with the information of the exercise.
